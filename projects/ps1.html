        <h1 class="h1">ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
        <div class="text1">SHELL and the Kraaijvanger Architects are building the biggest hydrogen facility in Europe. They need to cummunicate the building to the public through an experience that captures the green design of the building. </div>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h1 class="h1">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
        <div class="text1">The design and build of the Holland Hydrogen 1 is almoust finished and with this, Shell needs to communicate the building to the public in an interactive and engaging way. The design of the building is unique, it blends the green spaces and fauna around with the design of the building. As designers we need to find a way to interactively comunciate this design with the visitors of the facility.</div>
        <h1 class="h1">SOLUTION</h1>
        <div class="text1">We designed</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">PROCESS</h1>
        <div class="text1">We started off by exploring the problem and the assignment. Through desk research, observations and discussion we found the things that we did not understand and were vague.</div>
        <div class="text1">As a team leader, I worked on the structure for this phase of the project. I held team meetings, talked individually with the members of the team about their resposabilities and tasks.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">RQ&#x27;s</h1>
        <div class="text1">What is a positive footprint and how do people perceive positive footprint andenergy?2. How does the whole process of the building work and why is it sustainable?a. How do the flows in the building (air, material, water, soil, energy, biodiversityand stuff) have a positive outcome on the environment?b. How are people impacted by it?3. What do people already know about the circular economy, positive footprint and whatare they curious about?4. How do sustainable buildings express their sustainability?a. What does the building look like; feel like; smell like; does it give theimpression that it&#x27;s sustainable?</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">TARGET GROUP</h1>
        <div class="text1">Our process of forming Â a persona took a while. for this, we used interviews and examples of people.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">Methods</h1>
        <div class="text1">Shell is building the biggest Hydrogen plant in Europe and they need to communicate to the public the building and their energy transition.</div>
        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Uni Interviews</h1>
          <div class="text1">the uni interviews helped us create a persona based on fast and quick answers from a varied pool of people. It helped us do a comparison of what target group we have and we don&#x27;t based on comparisons. The uni interview was based in THUAS, we chose random participants to get a wide range of personas and people. By choosing diverse people we asked them the protocol questions and synthesized after</div>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Observations</h1>
          <div class="text1">The observations happened in 2 locations. First of all, we looked for a sustainable bar place in the hague to get information and and start gathering data. We managed to set on the sustainable farm (th enew farm) in the hague. we ended up finding that they are not in business anymore and bankrupt but we managed to talk to one of the people in there and got a tip about a sustainable restaurant.The team took of immediately to the sustainable restaurant and we managed to take pictures and have an interview with the owner of the restaurant. We took pictures and gathered information about the projects that we were doing. In the restaurant we observed the details and the types of objectst present and gathered by the owners of the bar. we had an analysis of the plan of the barIn the end we extracted key stuff and points about the architecture that will help us create later the guidelines</div>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Structured interviews</h1>
          <div class="text1">The structured interview gave us insights into the life of a person that lives it&#x27;s life sustainably and green. The detailes learned from the person and the principles and values that resulted from the conversatin, gave us insight into how he lives his life and where do the principles come from.These insigts gave us the depth of the persona</div>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Personas</h1>
          <div class="text1">The personas were created based on all of the characters and sustainable people that we interviewed together. We created personas to have an idea of who are the people that we are going to design for. Because Sustainability and green energy is usch a political topic, it&#x27;s hard to attract everybody and we wanted to filter the people that might be interested or not in our project.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Mind Map</h1>
          <div class="text1">Mind mapping we used as a technique in order to visualize all the elements that are present in the projects. We connected the stakeholders and defined how we work with each of them.We used in the stakeholder map, the green and sustainable elements like water, fauna, flora. even if they are not personas, we managed to understand the play and importance ine ach of them. this technique was inspired by reading objects project.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Moodboard</h1>
          <div class="text1">The moodboard created, helped us empathise with the feeling of sustainability. we creatd it ouselves and visualized how each of us has a vision of what sustainability is.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="div-block-2">
          <h1 class="h1">Insights</h1>
          <div class="text1">Insights were made through the technique of a synthesis wall.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">Findings and Direction</h1>
        <div class="text1">We created a synthesis wall that would help us synthesize all the data and findigs into actionable items. Our process included insights and design vision. This was created together in a team to get and create a direction for the next phases. Our insights were chosen out of a poool of insights created by the whole team. We managed to create separately insights based on each individual responsability and technique and then later get together to selectively pass the insghts.the direction was later added in the Design vision</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">Design Vision</h1>
        <div class="text1">*add pictures of design vision*the design vision was made in one joint session. though discussions and several opinions we managed to create something together and share what&#x27;s important for the client and for the project. The style of the design vision was made by only one of us so it is consistent. based on each insight, we looked for solutions and directions. Moreover, we had pain points for personas and the rest.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">Concept wall</h1>
        <div class="text1">To have a wide variety of options for prototyping, each member of the team had to create 5 concepts. Together, we managed to create 30 concepts from which we later chose for the final 3 concepts. The concept wall was done inside the university and other peers dot voted and gave feedback on our concepts. By the end, we had some people&#x27;s favourites concepts.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="section-3">
        <h1 class="h1">Concepts &amp; Client meeting</h1>
        <div class="text1">The next step was to meet shell and the architects and present them the concepts that we wanted to do. Together we created concepts based on the design direction that we had. because we were 6, we decided to share the responsabilities by making groups of 2 and we worked in parallel on defining the concepts. during the client meeting, we shared together the responsibility of presenting the concepts.The first concept was *screenshot*the second concept was * screenshot*the third concept was *screenshot*the client enjoyed a combination of the first and 3rd concept so we set up to combine them.</div>
