                <h2>About</h2>
                <p class="w60">The Municipality of Delft needs to transition to gas-free heating before 2050. The government’s immediate goal is 
                    to inform its residents about the importance of the transition and give alternatives to gas heating.  As a university project, 
                    I worked in an agile setup with other designers to find a solution for the client. The clients of the project were real.

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p class="w60"> The municipality has drawn up a heat plan for alternative solutions to natural gas heating. Their focus is on 
                    individual all-electric alternatives. The team needs to think of a method, service, instrument, etc to initiate or help 
                    one or more homeowners to make their home natural gas-free as soon as possible.
                </p>

            <div class="content-rw">       
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p class="w60"> We designed an interactive map focused on informing each resident about the transition options available 
                    to him, all while creating a feeling of community. Attached to the model is an interface that provides bespoke information 
                    and advice regarding each house in particular.

                        <p class="white"> To kick off the first sprint we needed to have a concept to work on. A concept that would address the problem and 
                            also inspire the clients. To create one, I organized a creative session for my team that helped us come up with 5 
                            ideas. After showing them to the client, we chose together the most exciting one.

                <h2 class="sct-titleb">What we did</h2>
                <p class="w70" > During our first sprint, we focused on creating our first prototype and conducting basic further research to fill in the 
                    gaps in our knowledge. Each team member contributed to the sprint by either creating testing plans, working on the digital interface 
                    or being involved in the physical prototype. During the first sprint, we changed our initial concept to a smaller map. We realized 
                    that prototyping the entirety of Delft was not a feasible option so we focused on one neighbourhood. We chose the neighbourhood of 
                    Buitenhof. Here, we created the first version of the digital interface and this helped us visualize how our prototype should work 
                    when the user interacts with it.

                    <p> My main role in this project was to create the physical map. During the first sprint, I focused on making a low-fidelity variant 
                        of the map to see how it would look. I used my iPad, Google Maps and rulers to accurately calculate the area of the model according 
                        to the real size of the neighbourhood. I carved the houses together with one of my teammates and placed them in their accurate 
                        position on the miniature model.

                        the members also worked on sending a survey to the residents of Delft and going through the answers. Their answer helped us 
                        understand what type of information we should give them and how much they know about the energy transition. We also had to switch 
                        the neighbourhood for our physical prototype to the neighbourhood of Tuitenhof

                <p> In the 2nd sprint, I took another approach to creating the physical prototype. I had to remap the miniature city to resemble 
                    Tuitenhof and made the decision the 3D-print the houses as the university had the equipment necessary. For this task, I researched 
                    details about the houses to get the models right when designing them. I took into consideration their shapes, sizes, placement 
                    of doors and many other things. Later, I created 3D models in SketchUp and after the first successful print, we glued it to a 
                    canvas and lit it up. This was a consuming process but I enjoyed the challenge.

                        printing errors and challenges that we faced when creating the model slowed us down considerably. The goal of the 3rd 
                        sprint was to finish the deliverables and prepare for the client presentation

                        with our tutors into the digital interface and putting all our forces in finishing the physical map. Moreover, we had 
                        to connect the two elements together and in the last days of the sprint, we introduced lights under the 3d printed houses 
                        and finished a plan to make it controllable from the interface. We also worked together on finishing the physical interface. 
                        Moreover, we scaled down our concept to an even smaller area since we did not have enough time to finish the entire 
                        neighbourhood.
