        <p class="p1">The Municipality of Delft needs to transition to gas-free heating before 2050. The government’s immediate goal is to inform its residents about the importance of the transition and give alternatives to gas heating.  As a university project, I worked in an agile setup with other designers to find a solution for the client. The clients of the project were real.

                    individual all-electric alternatives. The team needs to think of a method, service, instrument, etc to initiate or help 
                    one or more homeowners to make their home natural gas-free as soon as possible.

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p class="w60"> We designed an interactive map focused on informing each resident about the transition options available 
                    to him, all while creating a feeling of community. Attached to the model is an interface that provides bespoke information 
                    and advice regarding each house in particular.

                        <p class=""> To kick off the first sprint we needed to have a concept to work on. A concept that would address the problem and 
                            also inspire the clients. To create one, I organized a creative session for my team that helped us come up with 5 
                            ideas. After showing them to the client, we chose together the most exciting one.

                <h2 class="sct-titleb">What we did</h2>
                <p> During our first sprint, we focused on creating our first prototype and conducting basic further research to fill in the 
                    gaps in our knowledge. Each team member contributed to the sprint by either creating testing plans, working on the digital interface 
                    or being involved in the physical prototype. During the first sprint, we changed our initial concept to a smaller map. We realized 
                    that prototyping the entirety of Delft was not a feasible option so we focused on one neighbourhood. We chose the neighbourhood of 
                    Buitenhof. Here, we created the first version of the digital interface and this helped us visualize how our prototype should work 
                    when the user interacts with it.

                <h2 class="sct-titleb">My role</h2>
                <p> My main role in this project was to create the physical map. During the first sprint, I focused on making a low-fidelity variant 
                    of the map to see how it would look. I used my iPad, Google Maps and rulers to accurately calculate the area of the model according 
                    to the real size of the neighbourhood. I carved the houses together with one of my teammates and placed them in their accurate 
                    position on the miniature model.
