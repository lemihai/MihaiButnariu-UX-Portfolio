            The Philosophy and Professional Practice Research group has been exploring the impacts of new technologies on the education processes. 
            With the new developments in the AI field, the group started exploring the ways in which the students are including these tools in 
            their workflow and how it affects their thinking and their opinions.

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p class="w60"> With the rise of AI technology, students are using tools such as ChatGPT or Midjourney in the process of developing 
                    empathy with their target group. The challenge is to explore the impacts that these processes are having on the empathetic process 
                    and the results of research methods outputs.

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p class="w60"> I conducted research to answer my research questions in two phases with each of them having a clear outcome that
                    offers insights into the use of AI tools and their impacts. Besides the deliverables, I also compiled a research report that 
                    puts all the research methods and the outcomes together.

            <p class="subtitle"> I conducted research to answer my research questions in two phases with each of them having a clear outcome that
                offers insights into the use of AI tools and their impacts. Besides the deliverables, I also compiled a research report that

            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Methods</h2>
            <p class="w70" > Through a combination of methods, I explored the different ways in which students have been using AI in research. 
                Since the tools are very new, we did not even know how they were used and what for and why. Then I analysed the answers and coded 
                the interviews to draw correlations.

            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Interviews</h2>
            <p class="w70" > The interviews were focused on the overall experience of the users with the AI tools. What did they use it for, when, 
                and why did they use it? What did they want to achieve with this? With two rounds of coding interviews, I tried to maximise the quality 
                of my coding.

        <h4>RESEARCH PHASE 2</h4>


        <div class="content-rw">
            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Methods</h2>
            <p class="w70" > During the first phase, I observed how a couple of researchers have been using ChatGPT as a substitute for real users. I
                n a couple of instances, they have been telling GPT to act as a particular person and then answer questions in an interview. This 
                practice intrigued me and the reports of those researchers over the quality of the results were inconclusive. Further, I decided to 
                form an experiment where I test the effects of interviews
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-rw">
            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Interviews</h2>
            <p class="w70" > Have one researcher conduct a traditional interview with a real participant on a common topic. The 2nd researcher will 
                conduct an interview with chatGPT and MIdjourney. The role of this experiment is to test the levels of empathy these researchers have 
                with their target group when they use AI in their process.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-rw">
            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Interviews</h2>
            <p class="w70" > 
                The experiment was recorded from a couple of angles with a total of 3 cameras to capture data from all the parties involved. A total 
                of 18 participants were present in this phase. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>RESEARCH OUTCOMES</h4>

        <div class="content-rw">
            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Phase 1</h2>
            <p class="w70" > Among various reasons why people use AI, the most common were time constraints, budget constraints, and the desire to be more 
                accurate, efficient and productive. Most users included AI tools in all of their workflow with a greater use in ideation practices and research practices.
                

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-rw">
            <h2 class="sct-titleb">Phase 2</h2>
            <p class="w70" >     
                The research concluded that AI tools do not provide enough depth and authenticity to be able to create empathy with the users. Thus, it’s impossible 
                at the moment to have an AI accurately pretend to be a target group as it is stereotypical and shallow.
